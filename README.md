Winter is a text editor written in Go inspired by [Antirez](https://github.com/antirez)'s [kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) when I first saw it years ago. Winter is a very basic text editor and is very much a work in progress.

Features yet to implement are:

* Handling signals
* Handling large multi-line single lines.

Things I need to refactor:

* Remove commented code
* Add meaningful comments to packages
* Eliminate vendor packages by hosting them here

Kindly submit any issue you find and I will eventually fix it. Happy hunting and bundle up.
